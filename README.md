# Task Management


In this project, you can create a task by giving it a name, describing what needs to be done, and setting a deadline for when it should be finished.

Once you've created tasks, you can view them in a list. The tool allows you to edit the task details if needed, like changing the task name, updating the description, or adjusting the deadline.

You can also check the status of your tasks, seeing which ones are completed or still in progress. If anything changes, you have the flexibility to make edits whenever necessary. It's like having a personal assistant to help you stay on top of your tasks and manage them efficiently!
